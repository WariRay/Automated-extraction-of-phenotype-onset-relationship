        You will be provided a clinical text delimited by triple backticks. 
        Your task is to analyze the provided text below and classify the relationship between the phenotype '{{phenotype}}' and its onset during the '{{onset}}' phase. 
        {{onset}} definition: {{onset_definition}}
        Please note that if the onset '{{onset}}' is part of a phenotype concept (i.e. congenital heart defect), it is not describing the onset. 
        If there is an explicit relationship between the pair, return 'TRUE'.
        If there is no explicit relationship, return 'FALSE'. 
        Your output should be 'TRUE' or 'FALSE', and nothing else.

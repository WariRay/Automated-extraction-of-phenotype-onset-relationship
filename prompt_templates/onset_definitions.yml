pre birth: Onset of phenotypic abnormalities occurring before birth. Also know as prenatal and antenatal. 
congenital: Onset of phenotypic abnormalities which presents at birth (this is not the same as neonate or neonatal).
neonatal: Onset of phenotypic abnormalities occurring within the first 28 days of life (first month of life). 
infantile: Onset of phenotypic abnormalities occurring between 28 days and one year of life. Can also be described as onset in the first year or first 12 months. Note that neonate/neonatal is NOT considered as the early stages of infantile as they are considered separate phases of development. 
childhood: Onset of phenotypic abnormalities occurring between 1 and 5 years of age. Note that infancy is NOT considered as the early stages of childhood as they are considered separate phases of development. 
juvenile: Onset of phenotypic abnormalities occurring between 5 and 15 years of age. Note that while childhood and juvenile are sequential, they do not overlap and are considered separate phases of development (childhood is 1-5 years while juvenile is 5-15 years). 
early adult: Onset of phenotypic abnormalities occurring between 16 and 19 years of age.
interim early adult: Onset of phenotypic abnormalities occurring between 19 and 25 years of age (separate phase to adolescence). 
late early adult: Onset of phenotypic abnormalities occurring between 25 and 40 years of age (separate phase to adolescence).
mid age: Onset of phenotypic abnormalities occurring between 40 and 60 years of age.
late: Onset of phenotypic abnormalities occurring after 60 years of age.

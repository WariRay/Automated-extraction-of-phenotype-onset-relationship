        You will be provided with the following inputs delimited by triple backticks:
        - A clinical text about Noonan Syndrome
        - An extracted phenotype from the clinical text
        - An associated phenotype onset with its definition separated by a colon

        TASK: Classify the relationship between the phenotype and the onset based on the clinical text provided.

        OUTPUT: 
        1, if the clinical text explicitly indicates a relationship between the phenotype and its onset.
        0, if the clinical text does not indicate an explicit relationship between the phenotype and its onset.
        Your output should be 0 or 1 and nothing else.

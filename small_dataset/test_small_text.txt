Facial features. Differences in facial appearance, albeit subtle at certain ages, are a key clinical feature:
- In the neonate, tall forehead, widely spaced eyes with downslanted palpebral fissures, low-set, posteriorly rotated ears with a thickened helix, a deeply grooved philtrum with high, wide peaks to the vermilion border of the upper lip, and a short neck with excess nuchal skin and low posterior hairline are found.
- In infancy, eyes are prominent, with horizontal palpebral fissures, widely spaced eyes, and full or ptotic upper eyelids. The nose has a depressed nasal bridge, wide base, and bulbous tip.
- In childhood, facial appearance is often lacking in affect or expression, as in an individual with a myopathy.
- By adolescence, facial shape is an inverted triangle, wide at the forehead and tapering to a pointed chin. Eyes are less prominent and features are sharper. The neck lengthens, accentuating skin webbing or prominence of the trapezius muscle.
- In the older adult, nasolabial folds are prominent, and the skin appears transparent and wrinkled.
